# jGetReal
A pure-java image effect library. Can be used to apply a wide range of effects to images. Such effects include captioning, spin, sort, fuzz, and more. Most work with animated gifs, too!
## Why?
I don't really like imagemagick so I decided to see if I could write my own image captioner for fun. This is the result.
